# Introduction

Jump Scare is an open-source Chrome Extension that allows users to specify websites in which to randomly display a jump scare image and sound to remind them they don't want to be on that, perhaps unproductive, site.

## Installation

You can install and use this extension via the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore?hl=en)

## Usage

Once installed, find the Jump Scare icon in Chrome's extension toolbar. Click Options to display the options modal. In the options modal, type a list of comma-separated websites such as `www.facebbook.com,www.yahoo.com` and click save. Whenever you visit one of these sites, there is a 1/2 chance the jump scare happens at a random 0-10 second delay.

## Development

Once you have the source files, visit `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser. In the top-right, enable `developer mode`. Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the source directory. Every time you make changes locally, save them, and click `Load unpacked` again to refresh the extension in your browser.
